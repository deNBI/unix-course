# Unix course â€“ Introduction to basic Unix commands

On Unix, every user has a unique user name. When they log on to the system, they are placed in a home directory, which is a portion of the disk space reserved just for them. When you log onto a Unix system, your main interface to the system is  called the Unix Shell. This is the program that presents you with the dollar sign (`$`) prompt. This prompt means that the shell is ready to accept your typed commands.

Unix commands are strings of characters typed in at the keyboard. To  run a command, you just type it in and press the *Enter* key. We will look at several of the most common commands below. 

Unix extends the power of commands by using special flags or *switches*. Switches are usually preceded with a dash (`-`).
