# Unix course â€“ Introduction to basic Unix commands

On Unix, every user has a unique user name. When they log onto the system, they are placed in a home directory, which is a portion of the disk space reserved just for them. When you log onto a Unix system, your main interface to the system is  called the Unix Shell. This is the program that presents you with the dollar sign (`$`) prompt. This prompt means that the shell is ready to accept your typed commands. It is often preceded by the user name as well as the current directory.

Unix commands are strings of characters typed in at the keyboard. To  run a command, you just type it in and press the *Enter* key. We will look at several of the most common commands below.
Commands often have _parameters_, e. g. a file to work on. Theses are typed in after the command and are separated by spaces, e. g. `less pi_results.txt`.

In addition, Unix extends the power of commands by using special flags or *switches*. Switches are usually preceded with a dash (`-`), e. g. `ls -lh`.

## Tutorial

During this tutorial you will use the commands above. Your task is to identify the correct commands and execute them. Feel free to experiment. Take a look at the solution if necessary.

### 01 - Accessing the Virtual Machine

TODO

### 02 - Opening a terminal window

TODO

### 03 - Creating a directory to work in

1. Open the manual page of the command `pwd` by entering `man pwd`.
2. Find out your current (working) directory. (1 command)
3. If your current directory is not your home directory, please move to it. (1 command)
4. Now create a directory called `pi_calculation` and enter the new directory. (2 commands)
5. Confirm that your current directory has changed. (1 command)

<details><summary>Show solution</summary><pre><code>
pwd
cd ~
mkdir first_analysis
cd first_analysis
pwd
</code></pre></details>

### 04 - Running a simple program

A simple program that (slowly) approximates the number pi is available as a file at `/opt/calculate_pi`.

1. Please copy this program into your current directory. (1 command)
2. Inspect the file you just copied to get information about its file type. (1 command)
3. Please make the file executable (for you as the owner only). (1 command)
4. Now run the executable and watch how the pi approximation gets better over time. (1 command)
5. Stop the running program by pressing the key combination `Ctrl+c`.

<details><summary>Show solution</summary><pre><code>
cp /opt/calculate_pi .
file calculate_pi
chmod u+x calculate_pi
./calculate_pi
</code></pre></details>

### 05 - Running in background and saving output

We would like to save the results of the pi calculation program to a file instead of just displaying them on the screen.

1. Please run the pi executable again but this time send its output to a file called `pi_results.txt` in the same directory. (1 command)
2. Open a second terminal and enter a command that allows you to watch the output lines being written to the results file. **Note:** Bear in mind that a new terminal always starts in your home directory. (2 commands)
3. Stop following the results file. (1 key combination)

<details><summary>Show solution</summary><pre><code>
./calculate_pi > pi_results.txt
cd pi_calculation
tail -f pi_results.txt
# Ctrl+c
</code></pre></details>

### 06 - Inspecting and killing a running program



1. List your own running programs. (1 command)
2. Use the process ID (PID) of the still running pi calculation to kill it. The PID is in the first column of the program list. (1 command)
3. Verify that the pi calculation has stopped. (1 command or action)
4. Check the file size of the results file that the pi calculation has generated. (1 command)
5. Check the free disk space available. (1 command)

<details><summary>Show solution</summary><pre><code>
ps -x
kill 12345
ps -x     # or look at the first terminal
ls -lh
df -h
</code></pre></details>
